ResourceAllocator Module:
      Resource allocator is responsible for assigning servers for users based on their needs.

I have used rapidjson thirdparty library to construct and parse JSON data.
I have attached the PoshMain.exe in previous commit.
It can run on windows desktop OSs.

Here is the manual to executing the exe :

    1. When you run the exe it will ask for the filepath. Filepath is input json file. It should be in .txt format.
    2. Then It will ask for the how many CPUS required per hour for user mentioned price.
    3. When you give these inputs it will return the result in json format.
